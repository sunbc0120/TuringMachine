TuringMachine
=============

3-color 5-state Turing Machine that is interesting

Rule 14348906999989999925927 TM attracts me by the conciseness and neatness on both of its evolution and causal network appearances:

1) It is found that the position of TM head over time is good feature to determine whether a TM is interesting or not.

2) Interesting TM seems to have diverse frequency distribution over the head position.

3) The standard deviation of frequency distribution (SDF) will be larger for desired TM.

4) Plot SDF against TM Rules, and target TM is captured at maximum point, as indicated by the red circle.
